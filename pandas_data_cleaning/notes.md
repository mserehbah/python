Data cleaning means fixing bad data in your data set.

Bad data could be:

1. Empty cells

    # Empty cells can potentially give you a wrong result when you analyze data.

    # One way to deal with empty cells is to remove rows that contain empty cells.

    # This is usually OK, since data sets can be very big, and removing a few rows will not have a big impact on the result.

    ===============================================================

    # Another way of dealing with empty cells is to insert a new value instead.

    # This way you do not have to delete entire rows just because of some empty cells.


2. Data in wrong format

    # Cells with data of wrong format can make it difficult, or even impossible, to analyze data.

    # To fix it, you have two options: remove the rows, or convert all cells in the columns into the same format.


3. Wrong data

# Wrong data" does not have to be "empty cells" or "wrong format", it can just be wrong, like if someone registered "199" instead of    "1.99" .

# Sometimes you can spot wrong data by looking at the data set, because you have an expectation of what it should be.

4. Duplicates
